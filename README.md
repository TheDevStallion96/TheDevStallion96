Oh hey! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub, where the magic (and occasional chaos) happens.

About Me

🔥 Hi, I’m Tristan—aka @TheDevStallion96 (because plain usernames are boring). I’m a tech enthusiast who loves turning “Wouldn’t it be cool if…” ideas into real-world apps. Spoiler alert: sometimes they work, sometimes they just teach me patience (and debugging).

What I’m Working On

📚 Learning New Tech: If it involves code, there’s a 99% chance I’m poking around in it.

🚀 Building Cool Stuff: My projects are like my cooking experiments—some are brilliant, others… well, let’s not talk about those.


My Current Adventure

🌱 I’m on a quest to master Bash scripting and Docker, mainly so I can automate everything (even making coffee) and deploy code like a ninja.

Let’s Team Up!

💞️ Got an idea that needs building? Let’s make it happen—whether it’s a groundbreaking app or just a fun side project. I’ll bring the code; you bring the snacks.
⚠️ Warning: Collaboration may involve heavy usage of phrases like “Why isn’t this working?” and “Oh, it’s just a typo.”
🛠️ Bonus: I’m the kind of dev who writes commit messages that are 80% jokes and 20% useful. You’ve been warned.
